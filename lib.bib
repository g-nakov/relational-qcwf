abstract = {Intuitionistic linear logic regains the expressive power of intuitionistic logic through the ! (â€˜of course') modality. Benton, Bierman, Hyland and de Paiva have given a term assignment system for ILL and an associated notion of categorical model in which the ! modality is modelled by a comonad satisfying certain extra conditions. Ordinary intuitionistic logic is then modelled in a cartesian closed category which arises as a full subcategory of the category of coalgebras for the comonad. This paper attempts to explain the connection between ILL and IL more directly and symmetrically by giving a logic, term calculus and categorical model for a system in which the linear and non-linear worlds exist on an equal footing, with operations allowing one to pass in both directions. We start from the categorical model of ILL given by Benton, Bierman, Hyland and de Paiva and show that this is equivalent to having a symmetric monoidal adjunction between a symmetric monoidal closed category and a cartesian closed category. We then derive both a sequent calculus and a natural deduction presentation of the logic corresponding to the new notion of model.},

@book{Longly2015,
abstract = {This book offers a self-contained exposition of the theory of computability in a higher-order context, where 'computable operations' may themselves be passed as arguments to other computable operations. The subject originated in the 1950s with the work of Kleene, Kreisel and others, and has since expanded in many different directions under the influence of workers from both mathematical logic and computer science. The ideas of higher-order computability have proved valuable both for elucidating the constructive content of logical systems, and for investigating the expressive power of various higher-order programming languages. In contrast to the well-known situation for first-order functions, it turns out that at higher types there are several different notions of computability competing for our attention, and each of these has given rise to its own strand of research. In this book, the authors offer an integrated treatment that draws together many of these strands within a unifying framework, revealing not only the range of possible computability concepts but the relationships between them. The book will serve as an ideal introduction to the field for beginning graduate students, as well as a reference for advanced researchers.

@inproceedings{Atkey2014a,
abstract = {Reynolds' theory of relational parametricity captures the invariance of polymorphically typed programs under change of data representation. Reynolds' original work exploited the typing discipline of the polymorphically typed $\lambda$-calculus System F, but there is now considerable interest in extending relational parametricity to type systems that are richer and more expressive than that of System F. This paper constructs parametric models of predicative and impredicative dependent type theory. The significance of our models is twofold. Firstly, in the impredicative variant we are able to deduce the existence of initial algebras for all indexed=functors. To our knowledge, ours is the first account of parametricity for dependent types that is able to lift the useful deduction of the existence of initial algebras in parametric models of System F to the dependently typed setting. Secondly, our models offer conceptual clarity by uniformly expressing relational parametricity for dependent types in terms of reflexive graphs, which allows us to unify the interpretations of types and kinds, instead of taking the relational interpretation of types as a primitive notion. Expressing our model in terms of reflexive graphs ensures that it has canonical choices for the interpretations of the standard type constructors of dependent type theory, except for the interpretation of the universe of small types, where we formulate a refined interpretation tailored for relational parametricity. Moreover, our reflexive graph model opens the door to generalisations of relational parametricity, for example to higher-dimensional relational parametricity. {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM.},

abstract = {The $\lambda$-calculus is considered a useful mathematical tool in the study of programming languages, since programs can be identified with $\lambda$-terms. However, if one goes further and uses $\beta$$\eta$-conversion to prove equivalence of programs, then a gross simplification is introduced (programs are identified with total functions from values to values) that may jeopardise the applicability of theoretical results. In this paper we introduce calculi, based on a categorical semantics for computations, that provide a correct basis for proving equivalence of programs for a wide range of notions of computation. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

The aim of this paper is to use the different technology of internal category theory to re-examine Ma and Reynolds' definitions. Apart from clarifying some of their constructions, this view enables us to prove that if we start with a non-parametric model which is left exact and which satisfies a completeness condition corresponding to Ma and Reynolds `suitability for polymorphism', then we can recover a parametric model with the same category of closed types. This implies, for example, that any suitably complete model (such as the PER model) has a parametric counterpart.},
